\subsection{Technologies used for implementation}

  For a prototype, we decided to use the following framework to implement everthing:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Polymer
    \item Node.js
    \item MongoDB
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Task Generator combines trusted results assign to players;
      \item Always treat player as new player, but integrated as old player if exists;
      \item Use ROI matching rate as graph edge weight, eigenvalue as trust value of player;
      \item Disaster Evaluation use pre-defined weight, then defined the disaster level
    \end{itemize}
