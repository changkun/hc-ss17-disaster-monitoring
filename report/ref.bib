abstract = {This article is devoted to economical aspects of Human Computation (HC) and to perspectives of HC in economics. As of economical aspects of HC, it is first observed that much of what makes HC systems effective is economical in nature suggesting that complexity being reconsidered as a HC complexity and the conception of efficient HC systems as a HC economics. This article also points to the relevance of HC in the development of standard software and to the importance of competition in HC systems. As of HC in economics, it is first argued that markets can be seen as HC systems avant la lettre. Looking more closely at financial markets, the article then points to a speed differential between transactions and credit risk awareness that compromises the efficiency of financial markets. Finally, a HCbased credit risk rating is proposed that, overcoming the afore mentioned speed differential, holds promise for better functioning financial markets.},

abstract = {Since its introduction at CHI 2004, the ESP Game has inspired many similar games that share the goal of gathering data from players. This paper introduces a new mechanism for collecting labeled data using “games with a purpose.” In this mechanism, players are provided with either the same or a different object, and asked to describe that object to each other. Based on each other's descriptions, players must decide whether they have the same object or not. We explain why this new mechanism is superior for input data with certain characteristics, introduce an enjoyable new game called “TagATune” that collects tags for music clips via this mechanism, and present findings on the data that is collected by this game.},

Here, we advocate a different approach: the constructive channeling of human brainpower through computer games. Toward this goal, we present general design principles for the development and evaluation of a class of games we call “games with a purpose,” or GWAPs, in which people, as a side effect of playing, perform tasks computers are unable to perform.

@article{Cao2007,
abstract = {The paper is concerned with learning to rank, which is to construct a model or a function for ranking objects. Learning to rank is useful for document retrieval, collaborative filtering, and many other applications. Several methods for learning to rank have been proposed, which take object pairs as ‘instances' in learning. We refer to them as the pairwise approach in this paper. Although the pairwise approach offers advantages, it ignores the fact that ranking is a prediction task on list of objects. The paper postulates that learning to rank should adopt the listwise approach in which lists of objects are used as ‘instances' in learning. The paper proposes a new probabilistic method for the approach. Specifically it introduces two probability models, respectively referred to as permutation probability and top k probability, to define a listwise loss function for learning. Neural Network and Gradient Descent are then employed as model and algorithm in the learning method. Experimental results on infor- mation retrieval show that the proposed listwise approach performs better than the pairwise ap- proach},

abstract = {Peer-to-peer file-sharing networks are currently receiving much at- tention as a means of sharing and distributing information. How- ever, as recent experience shows, the anonymous, open nature of these networks offers an almost ideal environment for the spread of self-replicating inauthentic files. We describe an algorithm to decrease the number of downloads of inauthentic files in a peer-to-peer file-sharing network that as- signs each peer a unique global trust value, based on the peer's history of uploads. We present a distributed and secure method to compute global trust values, based on Power iteration. By having peers use these global trust values to choose the peers from whom they download, the network effectively identifies malicious peers and isolates them from the network. In simulations, this reputation system, called EigenTrust, has been shown to significantly decrease the number of inauthentic files on the network, even under a variety of conditions wheremalicious peers cooperate in an attempt to deliberately subvert the system.},

abstract = {The humanitarian situation has continued to deteriorate with uninterrupted violence and conflict from Government forces and Armed Opposition Groups. The advance of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) across large areas of Syria has severely impacted civilians, with reports of grave violations of human rights in areas under their control. Hostilities have damaged and destroyed emergency field hospitals, schools, water, and electricity services in densely populated areas where both local communities and the internally displaced reside. The total number of people in need of humanitarian assistance in Syria has reached 12.2 million, approximately 7.6 million of whom are internally displaced; the largest number of internally displaced persons in any country in the world. Civilians continue to be the primary victims of the conflict, rape and sexual violence, enforced disappearances, forcible displacement, recruitment of child soldiers, summary executions and deliberate shelling of civilian targets have become commonplace. Major challenges The magnitude of humanitarian needs is overwhelming in all parts of the country. The main priorities are treating and evacuating the wounded, providing food aid, water, sanitation and hygiene, health, and shelter. Prices of basic commodities continue to rise and the availability of food stocks in many parts of Syria is at risk. With 11.5 million people having fled their homes, shelter needs are high. Children and the elderly are most at risk. Protection remains of utmost concern, with very serious allegations of abuses reported against women and children adding to the persistent reports of indiscriminate killings and extra-judicial arrests. In the area of health, the long-lasting consequences of the conflict have left many without access to basic medical care. Shortages of qualified medical personnel and life-saving medicines, and the destruction of health infrastructure have left more than one million people without access to healthcare services. Reports estimate that more Syrians die due to health complications resulting from inadequate health care services than as a direct consequence of the violence. Medical facilities continue to be targeted by aerial bombardments, resulting in fatalities and destruction of facilities.},
