		The United Nations Children's Fund\cite{unicef1994state} is a United Nations programme headquartered in New York City that provides humanitarian and developmental assistance to children and mothers in developing countries. It works in 190 countries and territories to protect the rights of every child. UNICEF has spent 70 years working to improve the lives of children and their families. Defending children's rights throughout their lives requires a global presence, aiming to produce results and understand their effects. In Syrian, the UNICEF works on providing and transporting critical medicine, aid and supplies to the refugees living in the war areas. The challenges UNICEF meet is that there are many hard-to-reach (HTR) and besieged (BSG) areas and the supplies are very hard to be deliveried to these zones if the UNICEF have no idea about the real time war situation and the disaster level. It will cost too much for the UNICEF which is just a Non-profit organization, if they entirely hire employees to collect the data of war situation. Our work is to design and develop a Human Computation system by GWAPS\cite{lafourcade2015games}.
